# Why BURST?

As the advancement of AI progresses, more and more jobs will be lost and more and more people will be unemployable. Does that mean they will no longer be able to survive? Is that really fair? If it is not fair, then what is the alternative?

The alternative is to get do with the current economic model, and adapt a newer, fairer model which is grounded in the ideals of equality of opportunity, accountability, and decentralization.

BURST aims to be a store-of-accountability system that prevents bad actors from unfair hoarding of resources. BURST is not a cryptocurrency, its a framework that delegates a fair share of resources to each individual. BURST is grounded in the ideals of Universal Income, Free Market, and Decentralized Finance

BURST promises to be an honest alternative to the eventual mass poverty. Please refer to our living whitepaper to know in-depth about our vision.
